# Homelab One-Shot Deployment Workflow

**Total Time**: ~40 minutes (5 min validation + 20 min build + 5 min DNS + 10 min verification)

**Purpose**: This workflow prevents the 8 critical pain points that historically cost 45-60 minutes of debugging time. It enables Claude to deploy correctly on the first attempt.
